        About me
      </h1>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        Right now I'm one of the co-founders of OverpoweredJS (beta), a startup
        trying to make anti-bot protection and browser fingerprinting accessible
        for online businesses, mostly small and medium-sized ones.<br /><br />
        Thanks to this journey I’ve looked at business from legal, sysadmin,
        dev, and even sales and marketing angles. I always wanted to touch every
        side of business but never found the opportunity — had to build it
        myself.
        <br /><br />
        In my free time I dig into ethical hacking, OSINT, operating systems,
        bot dev, reverse engineering, economics, business, and everything that
        moves.

      <h1 style="text-align: center">How did I end up here?</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        It all started way back in 2014, I got my first touchscreen phone. I was
        10. Obviously the first thing I tried was installing games. All my
        friends were on Dream League Soccer 2014, and I wanted in. Hit install
        on Google Play, boom – error. No space. My Sony Xperia Tipo Dual had 4GB
        of storage, not enough for the game + OBB cache unpacking. Even the SD
        card wasn’t helping.<br /><br />
        Found a random guide online saying I could just download the OBB cache
        manually and unpack it into /Android/obb. At 10, I couldn’t believe
        something like that was real. Just... do that and it works? No way. Took
        me a week to build up courage. But I did it. Got zArchiver, unzipped
        that file into the right folder, not believing it would work — and boom,
        miracle, it launched.<br /><br />
        And that was my intro to the file system and realizing I know nothing
        (yeah yeah Socrates). The actual issue was Google Play needed 2.5x space
        to unpack + store the same cache. A year later, I flashed CWM recovery
        and leveled up from Android 4.0.4 to 4.4.0. Then I got into custom ROMs,
        kernels, and trying to stretch compatibility between my ancient phone
        and new games. Felt great unlocking installs that "shouldn’t" be
        possible.<br /><br />
        Then came 2016, my parents banned me from using the laptop. Forgot to
        take out the trash. They took away the charger. I had 2 hours of battery
        per day. Problem solved easily — a friend had the same charger. I
        started sneaking it and hiding it. Parents suspected nothing… until I
        got a little *too* happy. Next step? Password on the laptop.<br /><br />
        I stared at that damn login screen for two weeks. First attempt: flour
        on the keys and asking mom to type the password (I *did* turn away).
        Didn't work long-term, they changed it. So I made a bootable flash drive
        with Rescue Setup, added a new user account while “on allowed time”, and
        boom — they thought I was locked out, but I was vibing.<br /><br />
        Lotta folks been through similar phases. Wifite2 on Kali Nethunter,
        grabbing handshakes, intercepting parental logins on old HTTP Facebook
        via Interceptor-ng… that’s how it all began.
